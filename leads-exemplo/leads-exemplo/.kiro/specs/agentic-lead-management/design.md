# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture for an autonomous AI team system that functions as a complete sales, customer service, and marketing organization for a real estate business. The system employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture with specialized AI agents that collaborate to manage the entire customer journey while continuously optimizing performance through machine learning feedback loops.

The system is designed around the concept of an "AI organization" with clear command structure, specialized roles, and autonomous decision-making capabilities that mirror human business operations but operate at machine speed and scale.
